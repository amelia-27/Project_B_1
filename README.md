### Information
Amelia Ubben, Community Action Computing (CS150), March 3, 2025.

## A Thesis 
The socioeconomic development in Africa to export fuel and their lack of renewable 
electricity contributes to their high air pollution levels
## A Data
I used source code from https://github.com/Dashbookproject/plotly-dash to build my dashboard.
I used information from this article to guide my research and presentation: 
https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-africas-invisible-silent-killer-1

## A Context
Using world data to create an interactive dashboard, I wanted to convey a 
country's socioeconimic development compared to possible environmental consequences. 

## Strategies
I will be using blank space by using a webpage background that matches the graph background. 
I will use a clear call to action to make my story purposeful
I will make my dashboard interactive, but clearly guide the user to what I want them to see
(prevent this dashboard and presentation from being exploratory). 

### A Note: An AI tool was used for assistance with some components
I used a few prompts input in Copilot for assistance with the implementation of the animated slider and graph component. 
-Animated Slider: Gave me direction in what to include in my callback
-Graph component: Gave me direction in how to add the feature in my callback and callback function to work properly
